# terraform-aws-mssql-alarms
Alarms specific to MSSQL on RDS. 

The following alarms are created by default for the instance in the variable db_instance_id. They are loosely based upon the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-metrics.html#rds-cw-metrics-instance). Anomaly alarms have a suffix of _anomaly, and can be disabled with the parameter anomaly_actions_enabled.

NOTE: Performance Insights must be enabled on the target db in order for all alarms to populate.

Each alarm has the following variables, set with sensible defaults. All thresholds and evaluation period default settings can be overridden.
1. create_[alarm-name], which controls whether or not the alarm is created. Default is true. This variable offers the ability to not create a specific alarm. 
2. [alarm-name]-threshold. The number which must be exceeded to generate an alert.
3. [alarm-name]-evaluation-periods. The number of evaluation periods that must be exceeded to generate an alert.
